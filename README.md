# git repository for big data programming in python

This repository was created to house python programming for big data. Some of the programming languages used are `python's` *map/reduce*, `pysparks` *sparkSQL*, and `pysparks` *pandas-on-spark*.  Python notebooks available through Google Collab were used for smaller data sets. `pyspark` and it's `MLlib` library were accessed through North Carolina State University's JupyterLab hub.

To access the projects in HTML format and the `.ipynb` files, please visit my blog at [data analysis programming](https://bphigg.github.io/).

Thanks!
